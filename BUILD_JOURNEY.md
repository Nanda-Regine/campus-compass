## Vision

Campus Compass is not just an app — it is infrastructure for South African student success.
Every feature is built around one question: **what does a first-generation SA university student
actually need to survive and thrive?** NSFAS budgeting, load-shedding awareness, 11 languages,
crisis support, part-time work balancing — all woven together with an AI companion named Nova.

---

## Phase 1 — Foundation (Early 2025)

### What was built
- Initial Next.js 14 App Router project setup
- Supabase authentication (email + password)
- Basic profile and onboarding flow
- Core database schema: profiles, budgets, expenses, tasks, modules

### Decisions made
- **Next.js App Router** over Pages Router — future-proof, server components, streaming
- **Supabase** over Firebase — open source, PostgreSQL, native RLS, SA-friendly pricing
- **Tailwind CSS** — rapid iteration, consistent design tokens (teal/coral brand)
- **TypeScript strict mode** — catch errors at build time, not in production

### Challenges
- Structuring the App Router correctly (server vs client components)
- Setting up Supabase SSR cookies properly for session persistence

---

## Phase 2 — Core Features (Mid 2025)

### Study Planner
- Tasks tab: assignment tracking with priority, due dates, module links
- Timetable tab: weekly lecture grid
- Exams tab: exam countdown with venue tracking
- Modules tab: full module management with colour coding

### Budget & NSFAS Tracker
- Animated spending ring (live percentage indicator)
- NSFAS allowance breakdown (living, accommodation, books)
- Expense logging by category
- CSV export for NSFAS records

### Meal Prep Module
- 7-day meal planner
- Grocery list with price tracking
- Budget-aware meal suggestions

### Database
- 15 tables with full RLS policies
- Auto-triggers: profile creation, updated_at, task done_at
- Dashboard summary SQL view for performance
- 14 strategic indexes

---

## Phase 3 — Nova AI Companion (Late 2025)

### The breakthrough
This is where Campus Compass became something unprecedented in African EdTech.
Nova is not a generic chatbot — she is purpose-built for SA students.

### Architecture
- **Anthropic claude-sonnet-4-6** as the model
- **Prompt caching**: 5000-line knowledge base cached (~90% API cost savings)
- **Dynamic context injection**: student's actual budget, tasks, exams, mood fed each call
- **Crisis detection**: keyword matching triggers emergency resource display
- **Usage metering**: 10 free messages/month, unlimited for premium

### Nova Knowledge Base covers
- SA university system (25+ institutions)
- NSFAS rules and appeal processes
- Load-shedding study strategies
- Mental health resources (SADAG, university counselling)
- Learning science (spaced repetition, Pomodoro, retrieval practice)
- 11 official SA languages awareness
- Student finance (bursaries, part-time work rights)

### AI Features across the app
- Budget Coach: spending pattern analysis + personalised tips
- Study Assist: AI study plans, exam prep, grade calculator
- Recipe Generator: budget-aware recipes with cost breakdown
- Proactive Insights: Nova notices stress signals and nudges proactively
- Daily Check-in: morning AI-generated snapshot

---

## Phase 4 — Work Module + PWA (Early 2026)

### Part-Time Work Hub
- Job tracking (employer, type, hourly rate, status)
- Shift logging with clock-in/out
- Earnings history and projections
- **Conflict detector**: AI checks if shift clashes with lectures or exams

### PWA (Progressive Web App)
- Service worker for offline support
- Cached pages when no network (common with SA data costs)
- Install-to-homescreen for app-like experience
- Background sync ready

### Payments — PayFast Integration
- ZAR-native (R49/month premium)
- ITN webhook for real-time payment confirmation
- Subscription token storage for recurring billing
- Full payment audit log

---

## Phase 5 — Production Hardening (March 2026)

### Build status
- `npm run build` → PASSES — zero TypeScript errors
- 22 routes, all correctly classified (static vs dynamic)
- CSP headers, image optimisation, security headers in next.config.js

### Type system
- 522 lines of strict TypeScript types
- SA-specific enums: SALanguage (11), SAUniversity (25+), ExpenseCategories
- Full API response typing

### Security
- RLS on all 15 tables
- Service role client isolated to webhook-only routes
- Anthropic API key never reaches browser
- Next.js CSP headers configured

## The Bigger Picture

Campus Compass is building toward being the **operating system for SA student life**.
The goal is not just an app — it is a platform:

1. **Data layer**: Students consent to anonymised insights that help universities understand student stress, budget failures, and academic risk — sold back to institutions as aggregate analytics.

2. **Marketplace layer**: Verified tutors, textbook swaps, subletting listings, campus jobs — all within one trusted platform students already use daily.

3. **Financial layer**: NSFAS optimization, bursary matching, micro-loans for emergencies — partnering with student-focused fintech.

4. **Career layer**: CV builder, internship matching, skills gap analysis based on modules — the student-to-professional pipeline.

If we capture students at Year 1 and keep them through graduation, we own the most valuable demographic in African tech: the next generation of professionals.

## Phase 7 — March 2026 Sprint: Production Standards + Pricing Restructure

### Pricing Restructure (cost audit)
- **Free**: R0 — 10 Nova messages/month (was unchanged)
- **Scholar**: R39/month — 75 Nova messages (replaced "Student R29 / 50 msgs" — 63%+ gross margin)
- **Premium**: R79/month — 200 messages hard cap (replaced "R49 unlimited" — was loss-making at high usage)
- Nova message cost: ~R0.17/message at Sonnet 4.6 rates; R49 unlimited broke even at 240 msgs/month
- PayFast upgraded to recurring subscriptions (subscription_type=1, frequency=3 monthly)

### Bug Fixes

- **Login page missing Google OAuth**: Added Google button above email form with divider

### Analytics
- PostHog client-side analytics installed and wired into Providers.tsx
- User identified on login with tier, university, year, funding_type
- Pageview capture on every route change

### Domain
- varsityos.co.za purchased and wired throughout codebase (APP_URL, sitemap, robots, JSON-LD)

### Nova Tier Enforcement
- Server-side message cap by tier: Free=10, Scholar=75, Premium=200
- `subscription_tier` column added to Profile type for granular tier tracking
- GET endpoint returns correct messageLimit per tier

### PWA
- manifest.json: start_url fixed to "/" (was "/dashboard"), background_color/theme_color per spec
- Icon entries updated with separate PNG icons and maskable purpose

### CSP
- PostHog domains added to connect-src

### DB Migration
- MIGRATION_SCHOLAR_TIER.sql created (run in Supabase SQL editor)
- profiles: subscription_tier, referral_credits, ai_language columns
- Backfill from is_premium flag

### PayFast Webhook
- Updated to parse m_payment_id as 'userId|tierId' (scholar or premium)

---

## Phase 8 — Production Services & Deployment (April 2026)

### Vercel Deployment (2026-04-03)
- First successful production deploy via Vercel CLI
- Fixed build-breaking bug: `'use server'` directive incorrectly placed in `src/app/referral/page.tsx`
  (Server Components never need `'use server'` — that directive is for Server Action files only)

### Search Engine Verification
- **Google Search Console**: verification token wired via Next.js `metadata.verification.google`
- **Bing Webmaster Tools**: msvalidate.01 token added via `metadata.verification.other`

### Environment Variables — Full Audit & Fix
- Discovered `ANTHROPIC_KEY` was set in Vercel but code uses `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` — added correct key
- Added all Firebase `NEXT_PUBLIC_` variables (API key, auth domain, project ID, storage bucket, app ID)
- Added `NEXT_PUBLIC_CRISP_WEBSITE_ID` (layout used `NEXT_PUBLIC_` prefix but only `CRISP_WEBSITE_ID` was set)
- Added `NEXT_PUBLIC_SENTRY_DSN` for client-side error reporting
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_POSTHOG_PROJECT_TOKEN`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_POSTHOG_HOST`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_GTM_ID` confirmed present
- All PayFast, Supabase, ArcJet, Resend vars confirmed in Vercel

### Bug Fix — Firebase VAPID Key
- `src/lib/firebase-messaging.ts` line 64 was using `NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID` as the
  FCM `vapidKey` (incorrect — that's the sender ID, not the VAPID key)
- Fixed to use `NEXT_PUBLIC_VAPID_PUBLIC_KEY`

### CSP Update
- Added `https://o4511111217217536.ingest.de.sentry.io` to `connect-src` so Sentry can report errors
